  Have you noticed how some people dream of having their own business, but never seem to get started? If it is true that we live in a world of opportunity why is it that so few people succeed in obtaining their goals? Perhaps they can't afford to jeopardise their everyday job. Perhaps they don't have the start-up capital. Or perhaps they just don't know how to get started. Most commonly though the answer is more simple; <strong>they lack the commitment and do not have the patience to see their task through</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Successful people have something in common; <strong>they see their task through</strong>. The opportunity available through the <strong>2080group.net</strong> is not designed for the "Get Rich Quick" brigade. The 2080 Network Selling System is for those who seek independence and realise there is a proven path already available for them to follow.

  equipment and stock. With the <strong>2080group.net</strong> getting started could 
  not be easier. <strong>Simply send your application and &pound;99 
  to the office; this covers your membership fee, processing

  As a 2080 Group Internet Business Owner you are your own boss so you decide how much you earn. Right from day one you can start earning a profit. As well as earning sales profit you can immediately start laying the foundation for building your own network. Earning sales profit is essential and is at the core of any success in network selling, but by expanding your organisation and teaching others to duplicate your efforts the income potential is unlimited.

  Unlike most businesses you will not need an expensive office or warehouse facility to operate your business from. All you need is a table, a mobile/telephone and a briefcase/shoulderbag. You are encouraged to make money not spend it.

  Quite simply, the choice is yours. It is fair to say most people start their business on a part time basis. This allows them to build their business around their individual lifestyle; some go on to make their business a full time lifestyle. The important thing is the choice is yours, so long as you spend six to eight hours a week selling and training you can build a solid foundation for the rest of your life.
