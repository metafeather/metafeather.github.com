    <li>Do you have enough time to spend with your spouse or children?</li>
    <li>Will you be content with relying on the government to 
      take care of you and provide for your needs, or are you 
      the kind of person who wants to stand on your own?</li>
    <li>Have you ever wanted to be your own boss?</li>
    <li>Do you believe that the the online communications industry will 
      continue to grow for years to come?</li>
    <li>Do you know a few close friends or family members who, 
      if you asked them, would become your online customers - especially if it saved them money 
      and didn't change anything?</li>
    <li>Do you get personal satisfaction from helping others and 
      from surrounding yourself with interesting and successful 
      people?</li>
    <li>Do you strongly believe that the future can always be

      a chance and try something new?</li>
