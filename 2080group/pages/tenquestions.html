                      have the potential to grow in the future?</li>
                    <li>In the event of retirement, the loss of a job, or unexpected 
                      catastrophic expense, do you have enough savings that would 
                      permit you to maintain your current lifestyle?</li>

                      take care of you and provide for your needs, or are you 
                      the kind of person who wants to stand on your own?</li>

                      if you asked them, would become your online customers - especially if it saved them money 
                      and didn't change anything?</li>

                      people?</li>
                    <li>Do you strongly believe that the future can always be 
                      better than the past for those willing to work hard, take 
                      a chance and try something new?</li>
