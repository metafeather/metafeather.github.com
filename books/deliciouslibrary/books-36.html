                                        <p>The Final Chapter<br />
                                            Harry has been burdened with a dark, dangerous and seemingly impossible task: that of locating and destroying Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. Never has Harry felt so alone, or faced a future so full of shadows. But Harry must somehow find within himself the strength to complete the task he has been given. He must leave the warmth, safety and companionship of The Burrow and follow without fear or hesitation the inexorable path laid out for him.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In this final, seventh installment of the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling unveils in spectactular fashion the answers to the many questions that have been so eagerly awaited. The spellbinding, richly woven narrative, which plunges, twists and turns at a breathtaking pace, confirms the author as a mistress of storytelling, whose books will be read, reread and read again.<br />

                                            Favourite Moments from the Series<br />
                                            There are plenty of reasons to love Rowling's wildly popular series—no doubt you have several dozen of your own. Our list features favourite moments, characters, and artefacts from the first six books. Keep in mind that this list is by no means exhaustive (what we love about Harry could fill ten books!) and does not include any of the spectacular revelatory moments that would spoil the books for those (few) who have not read them. Enjoy.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone<br />
                                            * Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him.<br />
                                            * When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists.<br />
                                            * Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br />
                                            * Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<br />
                                            * The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores—gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden—this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius.<br />
                                            * Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother.<br />
                                            * The Duelling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Duelling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br />
                                            * Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'.<br />
                                            * Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book.<br />
                                            * Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behaviour in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children.<br />
                                            * The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom.<br />
                                            * Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<br />
                                            * Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up—the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them.<br />
                                            * Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione—and Ron's objection to it.<br />
                                            * Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge.<br />
                                            * Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br />
                                            <br />
                                            * Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming.<br />
                                            * Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone.<br />
                                            * Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager.<br />
                                            * Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape.<br />
                                            * Dumbledore's confession to Harry.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<br />
                                            <br />
                                            * This book is much darker than the rest. Lord Voldemort has been creating chaos in the Wizard and Muggle communities alike, the war is in full swing and the Wizarding community now lives in fear.<br />
                                            * It is much more emotional. The story turns at the whim of a temperamental teenager from war and life-changing tragedy, to euphoria and glistening happiness.<br />
                                            <br />

                                        <p>One of the most important recent developments in software engineering is the Unified Modelling Language (UML) standard for documenting software designs. Written by UML's inventors (the so-called Three Amigos of software engineering), The Unified Modelling Language User Guideprovides a very appealing guide to all the fundamentals of using UML effectively. The book opens with a basic tour of the essential concepts and modelling diagrams used in UML, including class diagrams, use case diagrams and basic modelling principles. The authors pay close attention to modelling classes (and documenting the relationships between classes) as well as use case diagrams (which show how software will be used by various actors in a system). This book mixes in a little software engineering theory, too, but it makes use of clear examples and actual UML diagrams to illustrate key concepts.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Later in the book, the authors discuss more difficult notational diagrams (such as state diagrams and activity diagrams, which can be used to model behaviour in a system). Whatever your background in software engineering, you'll no doubt appreciate the author's clear explanations of basic (and advanced) modelling concepts, as well as the nuts-and-bolts details of today's powerful UML. With its combination of expert modelling advice and excellent detail on the specifics of UML, this book will be absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to use UML for real- world software design. —Richard Dragan, Amazon.com</p>

                                        <p>A software process defines the steps required to create software successfully. Written by the same authors who brought you the Unified Modelling Language (UML), The Unified Software Development Processintroduces a new standard for creating today's software that will certainly be useful for any software developer or manager who is acquainted with UML.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Early sections introduce four basic principles of the unified process: that software should stress use cases (which show how it interacts with users), that the process is architecture-centric and that it is iterative and incremental. The authors then apply these principles to their software process, which involves everything from gathering system requirements to analysis, design, implementation and testing. The use-case examples are excellent and include concrete examples drawn from such areas as banking and inventory control.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            The authors point out the connection between UML document types (like use-cases, class diagrams and state transition diagrams) with various models used throughout the software process. They provide very short, real-world examples that illustrate how their ideas have been successfully applied. The straightforward tour of the new unified software process gets extra elaboration—along with some advice—in later chapters that further describe the author's ideas on design. With the weight of these three expert authors behind it, readers can expect The Unified Software Development Processto be an important book and one that will be valuable to any working designer or manager. —Richard Dragan</p>

                                        <p>Endorsed by no less than the hacker god, Kevin Mitnick, himself, Hack Proofing Your Networkis a collaborative work, with contributions from a dozen or so network security experts, many of whom were prominent in the hacking community until fairly recently. Now these poachers have turned gamekeeper and are selling their expertise to corporate networks anxious to prevent people like them from hacking their systems.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            The book is based on the rather shaky premise that you need a thief to catch a thief and so the best way to make sure your network security is up to scratch is to use "real world" hacking techniques to test it. To this end the book covers a wide remit, covering such areas as the hacker psyche, classes of attack, cryptography, buffer overflows, remote attacks, spoofing and viruses. The book is littered with fragments of sample hacking code, backed with URLs for hacking "resources". There is even a line-by-line analysis of the Melissa worm. Unfortunately, while there are plenty of examples of hacking code and tricks, the book is suspiciously light on measures you could take to prevent such attacks.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Overall, the book suffers from a lack of structure, being constructed from a large collection of hacker "nuggets" and this, coupled with the large number of authors makes Hack Proofinga rather bitty concoction, occasionally lacking coherence.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Whether the book will give you useful insights in to tightening security depends on your attitude to "ethical hackers". If you favour the concept, then this book will undoubtedly help you get inside the mind of the hacker and the tools they use. If you don't, then you will view this book as a thinly disguised Hacker's Handbook. —Roger Gann</p>

                                        <p>Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it. Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general — all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains: Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset Search engine features — crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in adataset Evolving intelligence for problem solving — how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful. Go beyond simple database-backed applications and put the wealth of Internet data to work for you. "Bravo! I cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods, nor can I think of a better way for me (an old AI dog) to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details." — Dan Russell, Google "Toby's book does a great job of breaking down the complex subject matter of machine-learning algorithms into practical, easy-to-understand examples that can be directly applied to analysis of social interaction across the Web today. If I had this book two years ago, it would have saved precious time going down some fruitless paths." — Tim Wolters, CTO, Collective Intellect</p>

                                            The qmail Handbook is designed to guide system and mail administrators of all skill levels through the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the qmail server. Author Dave Sill, a long-time qmail user, system administrator, and technical support agent (as well as the author of the popular online tutorial "Life with qmail"), provides you with the practical tools to work with this popular mail server.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Sill begins with a discussion of qmail's architecture and features, and then delves into a thorough investigation of the installation and configuration processes. You'll learn how to install qmail on several operating systems, and gain valuable insight into proper configuartion, testing procedures, and performance tuning. You'll also learn how to administer users and mail, install filters, and oversee daily qmail operation and maintenance. Throughout, Sill focuses on topics essential to all mail administrators, elaborating on such subjects as configuring mailing list managers, controlling spam, secure networking, scanning for viruses, hosting virtual domains and users, and creating dial-up clients.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            The qmail Handbook is the ultimate resource for administrators and developers needing to master the functionality of this powerful software.</p>
