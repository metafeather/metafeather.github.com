                                        <p>Broken Angelsis a standalone sequel, to Richard Morgan's debut novel Altered Carbon—a high-tech, ultra-violent, noirSF thriller which attracted much attention, including a movie deal.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Thirty years later, our super-soldier hero Takeshi Kovacs is wearing yet another body (swapping is easy in this future), already wounded in a messy war against revolutionary forces on the planet Sanction IV. Very soon he's lured from his duties into a hunt for a fantastic treasure discovered by archaeologists and carefully hushed up. The long-vanished Martians who once colonised the galaxy have left a buried hyperspace gateway leading to a working starship in distant orbit.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Kovacs uses frightening violence to get the attention of corporate sponsors even more ruthless than himself. His hastily assembled exploration team must work in a lethal fallout zone, racing to open the gate before they're stopped by radiation sickness, treacherous sabotage, or the threat of fast-evolving nanoweaponry. And there are repeated hints that if they ever make it through that gateway, worse things are waiting on the far side...<br />
                                            <br />
                                            It's all desperately tense and crafted with appalling inventiveness. Life is cheap and death is no release, because the "cortical stack" implanted in everyone's spine constantly records the total personality, ready for "re-sleeving" in a new clone body or storage in virtual reality. So Kovacs goes recruiting at the macabre Soul Market, where thanks to the war there are literal skiploads of hacked-out sections of human spine containing stacks—for sale by the kilogram.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Other ingredients include sex, voodoo, torture, multiple betrayal, cool military technology, incomprehensible alien constructions, age-old cycles of catastrophe, and—above all—extreme violence. The screw is turned further and further, beyond what seems possible. Readers may find themselves forgetting to breathe. This is a rattling good yarn, for the strong of stomach. —David Langford</p>

                                        <p>Woken Furiesis Richard Morgan's third noirSF adventure starring combat veteran Takeshi Kovacs, who debuted in Altered Carbon(2002; winner of the Philip K. Dick Award). Kovacs operates in an interstellar future of extreme violence and exotic weaponry, where swapping bodies is as easy as trading in an old car.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            The setting is Harlan's World, 95% ocean, where ancient alien orbital systems still vaporize anything that flies too high. Kovacs, older and madder, is running a private vendetta against Taliban-like fundamentalists whose principles—in a world where death is reversible—forced an old girl-friend and her child to die permanently. Wounded and on the run as usual, he escapes by joining a "deCom" squad hunting down human-built weapons systems that don't want to be decommissioned. Soon he's entangled with a woman who (some of the time) seemsto be a reincarnation of long-dead revolutionary leader Quellcrist Falconer…<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Meanwhile, the dictatorial ruling family of Harlan's World has set the deadliest possible assassin on Kovacs' trail—an illegal copy of his younger self, in a brand-new body.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            High-energy complications follow. There's unexpected violence in a virtual-reality monastery. Kovacs and "Quellist" sympathizers plan a crazy James Bond assault on an impregnable island fortress, an attack that ends in a surprise twist. The idealistic Quellcrist (if that's who she is) has the key to a genetic time-bomb never before used: "A whole new form of death." Even those implacable orbital weapons that smite high-fliers with "angelfire" have secrets of their own.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Morgan's knack for grisly set-pieces and heart-stopping violence makes for compulsive reading—emphatically not for the squeamish. Against all odds, his fast-moving choreography of pursuits, escapes, shoot-outs, reversals and betrayals finally ends in a satisfying touch of compassion, a trace of hope. A superior SF thriller. —David Langford</p>

                                        <p>Ringworld's Children returns series protagonist Louis Wu to the titular world. Louis and his friend The Hindmost, an alien of the Pierson's puppeteer race, are prisoners of the Ghoul protector Tunesmith, a Ringworld native, who is deliberately provoking the warships that surround his world. All the star-faring races of Known Space have sent warships to the Ringworld, and they are already at the brink of war. If fighting breaks out, the near-indestructible Ringworld will be destroyed and dissolved by antimatter weapons.<br />

                                            The Ringworld series is so complex and ambitious that Ringworld's Children opens with a glossary and a cast of characters, inclusions that even many Known Space fans will need. Newcomers to Niven's artificial planet should start with Ringworld. —Cynthia Ward, Amazon.com</p>

                                        <p>Middle books in fantasy trilogies are sometimes disappointing, but Garth Nix has created in Liraela fine successor to Sabrielthat both complements its precursor and sets up a mouth-watering dénouement for the final instalment in Abhorsen. Nix continues by setting this new story in the neighbouring worlds of Ancelstierre (no magic) and The Old Kingdom (lots of magic) but introduces several new and substantial characters that are as strong and fascinating as those in the first book.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In the Old Kingdom, while the Abhorsen Sabriel is off fighting the undead, who are waking in worryingly ever-increasing numbers, Lirael is alone in the glacial mountain kingdom of the Clayr dreaming of when she will receive the gift of "the sight"—which all true daughters of Clayr possess. She fills the long wait with years of self-taught charter magic and investigations into what lies in the depths of the Clayr library—a truly vast and ancient place.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In Ancelstierre, Prince Sameth, son of Sabriel and designated Abhorsen-in-waiting, is battling with his own inner demons. His own familiarity with charter magic is limited and it even sometimes scares him. This weight of expectation is crystallised when he is attacked by an evil necromancer intent on killing him. Sameth barely escapes with his life.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In these times of increased undead activity, Sabriel suspects a greater force at work. Sameth must return to the Old Kingdom and learn fast to help counter this enormous threat while Lirael too must play her part. She is a girl with an important destiny and is sent out towards the area of darkness and mystery that holds the key to what has been happening. Nix's imagination continues to impress all and his Sabrieltrilogy is so far proving to be the award-winning spectacle that it has promised to be. The book is recommended for ages 10 and above. —John McLay</p>

                                        <p>Imagine living in a city where the lottery has become the most important thing in everyone's life. Imagine that the lottery is based on dominoes, which only form their winning or losing combination as the Friday night draw is made. Imagine that people will kill to obtain winning dominoes. Imagine adverts exhorting you to play the lottery as they fly around in the air. Now set all that in Manchester in 1999.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Nymphomationpresents an alternate reality in which Manchester has become a test bed for the new game and its sinister undertones. The story is driven by characters recognisable as real people—students, street dwellers, musicians, waiters. They get caught up in what becomes for some of them a fight to the death to defeat the controlling power of the lottery and its head, Mr Million.<br />

                                            Noon writes with an accomplished mix of wit and darkness, and manages to invent a whole dictionary of new words along the way. Whoompy burgers sponsor the police and control the Net, blurbflies carry the adverts around the streets and the nymphomania itself tries to control but has to be controlled. The upshot is an imaginative and disturbing horror/cyberpunk/science fiction mix with plenty of harsh reality and social comment thrown in. —Sandra Vogel</p>

Here we go again with Jeff Noon's own highly idiosyncratic approach to life, technology, England and literature. After four novels - Vurt, Pollen, Automated Aliceand Nymphomation- Noon has now assembled over 50 fragmentary stories (although the word "story" does not give anything like an accurate representation of these charged pieces of imaginative mayhem) that skip around from adverts to fairy tales, from weirdly rough-cut poetry to highly unorthodox board games. "For my seventh birthday I asked my dad to steal us a bike" asks the splendidly unsentimental narrator of Pixel Face. "I can't locate that shit", replies the hassled father, "How about a new computer?""I tell him I've got two already", replies the charming son, "and if he doesn't deliver the bike, I'm telling the cops about him". All you need to know about the mores and morality of the future is in this book. —Nick Wroe</p>

                                            Needle In The Groove, Jeff Noon's fifth novel, follows his short story collection Pixel Juiceand confirms him as one of the most inventive and exciting of modern British writers. Set, like his previous books, in a slightly futuristic, reimagined Manchester (where, in this novel, streets are named after musicians and bands such as Joy Division, The Fall, 808 State and A Guy Called Gerald), the book follows Elliot Hill, a bass player and ex-junkie trudging the pub-rock circuit, who is invited to join a new band: fusing DJ artistry, voice and rhythm section, the group's hypnotic groove creation is augmented by a startling new recording technology. The band seems bound for success—until one of them vanishes. Elliot's subsequent search draws him into a secret history of music that stretches back 40 years and into his own past.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Noon's admitted affinity for music over literature as a source for inspiration takes concrete form here: the book takes the idea of the remix as it's formal—and thematic—principle. Where William Burroughs, in the 1950s and '60s, looked to collage—to formal innovation in the visual arts—as inspiration for his textual cut-ups, Noon's spur for rethinking modern prose is the revolution in music in the last two decades: the sample, the mix and the manipulation of sound provide the lexicon and grammar for his experiments with language. Although by no means the first to rethink writing in this way (Kodwo Eshun's "conceptual engineering" in More Brilliant than the Sunor Simon Reynolds' take on dance music in Energy Flashapply sonic invention and mixology to music criticism), Noon's use of musical techniques genuinely attempts to extend the possibilities of fiction. Love, desire, the metaphoric architecture of literature are all reimagined through his "liquid dub poetics": by taking near-clichés of fiction—the tensions between father and son, the (bizarre) love triangle—and subjecting them to the interference of linguistic experiment, Noon balances a compelling, straight narrative against the warped logic of the mix. It reads like a technologised, nervy version of Modernist stream of consciousness, punctuated by the backslash, that ubiquitous partitioner of URLs and familiar of Web-surfers everywhere. Pulp fiction meets dub? Just get into the groove. —Burhan Tufail</p>
