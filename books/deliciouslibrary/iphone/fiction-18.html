                                    <p>Michael Scott Rohan's "Winter of the World" fantasies began with an epic, Wagnerian 1986-8 trilogy set in prehistoric Ice Age days, with the life-hating Ice opposed by other, kinder Powers who favour humanity. The Castle of the Winds(1998) takes place a millennium earlier, and the stand-alone The Singer and the Seafeatures the now grown-up apprentices of that book's Mastersmith—randy Gille the singer and the mighty Olvar. Gille's wild fling with a minor female Power of sea and air sets him longing for sea travel. His and Olvar's resulting trade voyage to the rich South goes astray as they follow a plea for help, to find the island refuge of a tough but innocent tribe harried by murderous black longships of the Ice. Desperate sea-skirmishes ensue, with the outnumbered merchants managing to give the enemy some ingenious surprises. Even with Southern naval reinforcements, though, our heroes seem helpless against the might of the main black fleet—but Gille unwittingly has contacts in high places, or deep ones, and finds himself singing for his life in the ocean-god's undersea court. Rohan strikes a stirring high-fantasy note as—with Gille's song as catalyst—the chief Powers of sea and fire at last begin to move directly against the Ice. The story ends satisfyingly. —David Langford</p>

                                    <p>The Final Chapter<br />
                                        Harry has been burdened with a dark, dangerous and seemingly impossible task: that of locating and destroying Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. Never has Harry felt so alone, or faced a future so full of shadows. But Harry must somehow find within himself the strength to complete the task he has been given. He must leave the warmth, safety and companionship of The Burrow and follow without fear or hesitation the inexorable path laid out for him.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        In this final, seventh installment of the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling unveils in spectactular fashion the answers to the many questions that have been so eagerly awaited. The spellbinding, richly woven narrative, which plunges, twists and turns at a breathtaking pace, confirms the author as a mistress of storytelling, whose books will be read, reread and read again.<br />

                                        Favourite Moments from the Series<br />
                                        There are plenty of reasons to love Rowling's wildly popular series—no doubt you have several dozen of your own. Our list features favourite moments, characters, and artefacts from the first six books. Keep in mind that this list is by no means exhaustive (what we love about Harry could fill ten books!) and does not include any of the spectacular revelatory moments that would spoil the books for those (few) who have not read them. Enjoy.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone<br />
                                        * Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him.<br />
                                        * When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists.<br />
                                        * Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br />
                                        * Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<br />
                                        * The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores—gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden—this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius.<br />
                                        * Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother.<br />
                                        * The Duelling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Duelling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br />
                                        * Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'.<br />
                                        * Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book.<br />
                                        * Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behaviour in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children.<br />
                                        * The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom.<br />
                                        * Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<br />
                                        * Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up—the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them.<br />
                                        * Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione—and Ron's objection to it.<br />
                                        * Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge.<br />
                                        * Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br />
                                        <br />
                                        * Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming.<br />
                                        * Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone.<br />
                                        * Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager.<br />
                                        * Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape.<br />
                                        * Dumbledore's confession to Harry.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<br />
                                        <br />
                                        * This book is much darker than the rest. Lord Voldemort has been creating chaos in the Wizard and Muggle communities alike, the war is in full swing and the Wizarding community now lives in fear.<br />
                                        * It is much more emotional. The story turns at the whim of a temperamental teenager from war and life-changing tragedy, to euphoria and glistening happiness.<br />
                                        <br />

                                        "I am an extraordinarily lucky person, doing what I love best in the world. I’m sure that I will always be a writer. It was wonderful enough just to be published. The greatest reward is the enthusiasm of the readers." —J.K. Rowling<br />

                                    <p>Olaf Stapledon's first novel Last and First Men, published in 1930, has sometimes been called science fiction's Bible—a sweeping, exhilarating history of humanity's future. Its awesome timescale, stretching across five billion years, was an inspiration to the young Arthur C. Clarke, who later wrote: "No book before or since ever had such an impact on my imagination." However, Last and First Menshould come with a health warning: The early chapters, dealing with near-future politics from the viewpoint of 1930, are mired in dodgy short-term speculation and have dated badly. Soon Stapledon rings down the curtain on us "First Men" as an uncontrolled nuclear reaction sweeps the world and boils the oceans—and now his imagination takes flight. The Second Men are plagued with invasions of cloud-like Martians; the bat-eared, six-fingered Third Men deliberately create the Fourth Men who are essentially huge, immobile brains ... and so on through ever-vaster gulfs of time. Individuals, nations, civilizations, even species are evocatively shown as mayflies flickering in and out of existence in an immense, chilly cosmos that goes uncaringly on forever. Yet it's not a gloomy work: even as the dying Sun promises to become their funeral pyre, the Last Men affirm that "It is very good to have been man." Another classic choice from Millennium SF Masterworks. —David Langford</p>

                                    <p>Brian Aldiss calls this 1937 SF classic "the most wonderful novel I have ever read", and its Millennium Masterworks reissue adds admiring remarks by Jorge Luis Borges, Arthur C Clarke, Doris Lessing, Virginia Woolf among others. Olaf Stapledon is better known for Last and First Men (1930), a sweeping history of the future whose early chapters are now embarrassing—but Star Maker leaps straight into a unfurling vision of infinity.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Looking at the starry night from an English hillside, the unnamed narrator is snatched from his earthly body and flung through space at impossible acceleration, soon outstripping light. He visits other stars, sees other worlds and alien races, a gallery of SF marvels in documentary rather than story form. (Some of this now seems over-familiar, however fresh and new in 1937: the book drags a little here.) Fellow disembodied intelligences from the galactic community join our hero, sensing something beyond mere matter and energy:<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The felt presence of the Star Maker remained unintelligible, even though it increasingly illuminated the cosmos, like the splendour of the unseen sun at dawn.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        But the godlike Star Maker is not exactly God, as we see when the scope expands beyond one mere universe to show an endless cycle of creations, many of them being crude and "immature" products of this experimenter's hand. Further "mature" creations follow, foreshadowing the Ultimate Cosmos whose crystalline perfection is not comforting but terrifying. Star Maker's final unsparing evocation of the deep chill of infinity has even been compared to Dante. —David Langford</p>

                                    <p>From the opening line of his breakthrough cyberpunk novel Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson plunges the reader into a not-too-distant future. It is a world where the Mafia controls pizza delivery, the United States exists as a patchwork of corporate-franchise city states, and the Internet—incarnate as the Metaverse—looks something like last year's hype would lead you to believe it should. Enter Hiro Protagonist—hacker, samurai swordsman and pizza-delivery driver. When his best friend fries his brain on a new designer drug called Snow Crash and his beautiful, brainy ex-girlfriend asks for his help, what's a guy with a name like that to do? He rushes to the rescue. A breakneck-paced 21st-century novel, Snow Crashinterweaves everything from Sumerian myth to visions of a postmodern civilization on the brink of collapse. Faster than the speed of television and a whole lot more fun, Snow Crashis the portrayal of a future that is bizarre enough to be plausible. —Acton Lane</p>
