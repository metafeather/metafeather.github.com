                                    <p>A hit in Europe but a flop in the US—where it was trimmed, rescored, and given a new ending—Luc Besson's The Big Blue has endured as a minor cult classic for its gorgeous photography (both on land and underwater) and dreamy ambiance. Jean-Marc Barr is a sweet and sensitive but passive presence as Jacques, a diver with a unique connection to the sea. He has the astounding ability to slow his heartbeat and his circulation on deep dives, "a phenomenon that's only been observed in whales and dolphins until now," remarks one scientist. Kooky New York insurance adjuster Joanna (Rosanna Arquette at her most delightfully flustered and endearingly sexy best) melts after falling into his innocent baby blues, and she follows him to Italy, where he's continuing a lifelong competition with boyhood rival Enzo (Jean Reno in a performance both comic and touching).<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Besson's first English-language production looks more European than Hollywood, and it suffers from a tin ear for the language. At times it feels more like an IMAX undersea documentary than a drama about free divers, but the lush and lovely images create a fairy tale dimension to Jacques's story, a veritable Little Merman. More dolphin than man, he's so torn between earthly love and aquatic paradise that even his dreams call him to the sea (in a sequence more eloquent than any speech).<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Besson has expanded the film by 50 minutes for his director's cut, which adds little story but slows the contemplative pace until it practically floats in time, and has restored Eric Serra's synthesizer-heavy score, a slice of 1980s pop that at times borders on disco kitsch. Most importantly, he has restored his original ending, which echoes the fairy tale he tells Joanna earlier in the film and leaves the story floating in the inky blackness of ambiguity. —Sean Axmaker, Amazon.com</p>

                                    <p>Spaced is a sitcom like no other. The premise is simple enough: Daisy (Jessica Stevenson) and Tim (Simon Pegg) are out of luck and love, so pretend to be a couple in order to rent a flat together. Downstairs neighbour and eccentric painter Brian suspects someone's fibbing, and almost blows their cover with their lecherous lush of a landlady, Marsha. Fortunately he soon falls for Daisy's health-freak friend Twist, while Daisy herself goes ga-ga for pet dog Colin. Tim remains happily platonic with lifemate Mike; a sweet-at-heart guns 'n' ammo obsessive. The series is chock-full of pop culture references. In fact, each episode is themed after at least one movie, with nods to The Shining and Close Encounters of the Third Kind proving especially hilarious. Hardly five minutes goes by without a Star Wars reference, and every second of screen time from Bill Bailey as owner of the comic shop where Tim works is comedic gold. The look of the series is its other outstanding element, with slam-zooms, dizzying montages, and inspired lighting effects (often paying homage to the Evil Dead movies). It's an affectionate fantasy on the life of the twenty-something that's uncomfortably close to the truth.<br />

                                    <p>The second series of Spaced finds the gang at 23 Meteor Street a little older, but definitely none the wiser. Tim's career is hampered by severe hang-ups over The Phantom Menace. Daisy's career is just plain non-existent. There is still a spark of sexual tension between them, but it's overshadowed by Brian and Twist getting it on. Propelling the seven-episode series arc is the threat of Marsha discovering that none of the relationships are what they seem, Mike's increasing jealousy and a new love interest for Tim. That's the basis for a never-ending stream of in-jokes and references that easily match the quality of the first series. Tim has a Return of the Jedi flashback, then déjà vu in reliving the end of The Empire Strikes Back. There are spoofs of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Robocop, The Sixth Sense and comedy rival The Royle Family. There are guest spots from Bill Bailey, Peter (voice of Darth Maul) Serafinowicz and The League of Gentlemen's Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith. Every episode is packed with highlights, but this series' guaranteed geek pant-wetting moments have to be the mock gun battles, slagging off Babylon 5 and learning that "The second rule of Robot Club is: no smoking." Jessica Stevenson won a British Comedy Award for this year. It deserved a whole lot more.—Paul Tonks<br />

                                        On the DVD: There's a chaotic but highly enthusiastic commentary from the director and cast, including of course Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, who also talk about some deleted scenes and why they were removed. There's an outtakes blooper reel, as well as a selection of raw location footage and a self-explanatory clip, "Daisy Does Elvis". The most useful feature, though, is the subtitle "Homage-o-Meter" facility, which displays all the movie references throughout the series. —Mark Walker</p>

                                    <p>Jack McCoy and Billabong are re-releasing the classics, Bunyip Dreaming, Sons Of Fun, The Green Iguana and Sik Joy in a special edition four pack DVD box set. The old VHS copies must have the tape burnt off them due to excessive play so its time to upgrade those treasured puppies to digitally remastered sweetness. Days and days of flat day viewing featuring all your favourites, Occy, Munga, Luke Egan and the emerging young talents of Donovan, Margo and Shane Dorian. When McCoy was rolling precious film on these boys during the mid nineties, times were different and movie deadlines were dictated by time spent in the pit, not the labour of following phantom Internet swells around the globe. Mate, back then we wouldnt even look at the forecast, Margo recalls. It was all about rocking up to a place for a few weeks and just dealing with whatever we got. Nine times out of ten it just panned out. I mean I was twenty years old, just cruising around, surfing the best waves in Australia. The early McCoy classics didnt mess about when it came to the beats either, rocking the likes of Powder Finger, Celibate Rifles, INXS, Hunters and Collectors, The Cruel Sea, Yothu Yindi, Ed Kuepper and Dig. McCoy has returned to edit room and created a Making Of that takes you behind the scenes of each separate classic. Expect to see candid cuts that never made the original edits and some all time bonus clips on this new special set. Over the last two years on the road showing Blue Horizon and Free As A Dog people were constantly asking me when Bunyip, Iguana, Sons, and Sik Joy were going to make it to DVD, said McCoy. After many years, I finally sat down and watched them again and was pleasantly surprised how entertaining and fun they are today. I think they have really stood the test of time and I decided it was time to get them out on DVD. This will really bring back memories for all the people who have called them Classics for many years.</p>
