                                    <p>In a nutshell:<br />
                                        Far Cry: Instincts sees you stuck on a gloriously rendered tropical island filled with lush jungle, limpid pools and heavily tooled-up mercenaries. Open-ended encounters offer far more cerebral exercise than your average run-and-gun, as well as the requisite trigger-pumping action. And then you start to discover the islands nasty little secrets…<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The lowdown:<br />
                                        Although the full story mode is not in place yet, the environments, their contents and the sparse but important vehicles point to an exceptionally interesting console conversion of the PC classic. Graphics remain tantalisingly sharp and an underwater swim in one of the island’s many lagoons is exceptionally refreshing.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Most exciting moment:<br />
                                        So it’s you versus the mercenaries in a straightforward shooting match, right? Wrong. Far Cry has quite a few more tricks up its sleeve…<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Since you ask:<br />
                                        Along with guns, explosives and vehicles, you can also set, bait and quietly observe traps in the undergrowth.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The bottom line:<br />
                                        If looks could kill, this would be lethal at 10 paces—how the rest fits together, time will tell.<br />

                                    <p>Renaissance Italy isn't the usual sort of setting for a video game, but then Assassin's Creed isn't one to play by the rules. Ezio Auditore di Firenze is yet another ancestor of modern day Desmond Miles - a nobleman out to avenge the death of his family in the guise of a shadowy assassin.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Like the last game you're given total freedom to explore multiple cities, but with greatly improved parkour skills and the new ability to swim. There's also a lot more variety in the missions you undertake - the main complaint with the original game- so you'll never feel you're just doing the same tasks over and over again.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Combat has also been completely overhauled, with dozens of different weapons and a new health system. With no less than Leonardo da Vinci acting as your very own Q style gadget master this stunning sequel improves on every element of the original. Renaissance man: Play as an all-new character in 15th century Italy, with new abilities, new weapons and a whole new world to explore.The spice of life: Massively improved mission variety, with new freeform mission structures and many more random events.Tools of the trade: All-new combat system lets you steal weapons from your opponents, use dual hidden blades and even an early form of pistol.Real history: Meet historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Niccol Machiavelli and Lorenzo de' Medici, all of whom can offer you their own unique brand of aid.Tourist spots: Explore real world locations including Rome, Venice, Florence and Tuscany, as well as specific landmarks such as the Grand Canal and St Mark's Basilica.</p>
