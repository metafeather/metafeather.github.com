                                    <p>In the PlayStation 2's first few months there were only a few standout games; one of them, SSX, brought snowboarding to people who didn't even like snowboarding. Now, only a year later, PS2 fans get a new reason to stay indoors during the cold winter months. SSX Trickyis its name, and it more than lives up to the moniker.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        SSX Trickyremoves two characters from the previous game and adds five new ones and adds two new race locations&#151;Garibaldi and Alaska&#151;to the already beefed up World Circuit. Features have also been added to the older tracks, effectively making them new again. Trickyimproves the graphics a bit and refines the controls. The game also tweaks the basic gameplay by letting you upgrade your boarder's stats in races, but also forcing you to attempt and master the show-off mode as well. And they went a long way toward improving the challenge by evening out the learning curve. The first game tended to be a cakewalk until the later races in each set; this time your rivals get more intense and aggressive depending upon the lap you're taking.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        As in the first game, personality is everything&#151;not only in terms of voice acting, but also in how you treat the other riders. The game has three basic attitudes in regard to you. If you block and attack characters too much, they'll remember it and actively seek you out. If you help one or two of them they become your allies, warning you of danger or fending off attackers.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        In many ways SSX Trickyis only an upgrade to the previous game. Admittedly, what's been added doesn't look like enough to equal buying the game all over again. But these changes are deep enough to change everything, and delight even fans who are tired of, or mastered, the first game. Maybe that's the most impressive über-trick of them all. &#151;Bob Andrews

                                    <p>Jedi Starfighteris the latest in that much abused of gaming genres, the Star Warsgame. Included in the few gems was Jedi's prequel, Star Wars: Starfighter, a cockpit-view shooter that stood out among early PS2 titles. Jediserves more as an extra set of missions than a full-blown follow-up, but there are some new features and the gameplay feels a lot smoother. The finest of these new additions are the Force weapons; when playing as the Starfighter itself, you're able to utilise the Force to unleash mass devastation on your foes. The 15 missions alternate between control of this craft and a more robust ship well stocked with missiles; despite being based around a basic protect-and-shoot premise, the missions are nicely varied in style.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The controls are baffling at first but you'll soon be pulling off some outrageous manoeuvres as you hunt down the enemy ships while issuing commands to your comrades. The graphics in these dogfights are fantastic, especially when using the zoom option, but larger ships tend to explode in a less than convincing fashion. The lack of recognisable characters, bar an appearance from Mace Windu and a Yoda voiceover, does detract, as does the lack of the classic Star Warsships (the game is based indirectly on Episode 2). This is partially made up for by an unlockable Tie Fighter along with some new missions and some truly bizarre bonus material. While being a bit too similar to the previous game to warrant buying both, Jedi Starfighteris a very accomplished title that only suffers slightly from its repetitive nature.&#151;Jonathan Winter

                                    <p>Console owners have been waiting a long time for Deus Ex. The seminal PC game, which seamlessly blends action, adventure and role-playing elements into one near perfect package, has now landed on the PS2, and luckily it's pretty much intact.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        It's 2052 and you play JC Denton, a nanotechnologically-enhanced, trench coat-wearing employee of anti-terrorist organisation UNATCO. At the beginning of the game, UNATCO is embroiled in a war with one particular faction who is demanding vaccines for a deadly virus sweeping the planet. As the game progresses and more and more information about the true motivations of both terrorists and UNATCO surface, Denton begins to question his allegiances.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Essentially Deus Exis a first-person shooter, but with a hefty helping of role-playing game. As you progress you get experience points which you can distribute across Denton's various skills, from hacking to weapons. How you solve a particular problem decides how many points you get and wading in guns blazing isn't always the best response. There are also a lot of non-player characters in the game from whom you can extract information, thus furthering the story, unlocking sub-missions and generally immersing you in the game's narrative. It's the story that really raises Deus Exto classic status, though it's also incredibly atmospheric, completely interactive and effortlessly stylish.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        The PS2 version is a direct port of the PC game; the control system takes a bit of getting used to if you are a seasoned PC FPS player and there are some issues with the graphics, which are blocky in places, but the rich gameplay more than makes up for any small niggling failings. This is a brilliant game on any format. &#151;Kristen Bowditch

                                        There are three modes of play&#151;game, workout and lesson. Game Mode allows you to choose to play the arcade version (one player), a two-player challenge, or for the truly gifted, there's Double-game play&#151;one player, two dance mats. With an incredible choice of tracks and some inspirational cheering ("You're a super dancer!") from the voice-over guy you'll have danced yourself dizzy in no time. Bonuses are awarded for free-style moves, with additional tracks and hidden items unlocked as the game progresses.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Got no rhythm? Are you a dance mat beginner? Check yourself into Lesson Mode&#151;with three lessons comprising eight separate sections you should master dance mat basics and get yourself familiar with some moves and sequences within an hour. Or if you're after an alternative to sweating it out in the gym or jogging the same streets, try Workout Mode&#151;set your own goals, choose your workout type and watch the calorie counter ticking over.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Dancing Stage MegaMixis for everyone&#151;with dancefloor favourites from Kylie and Elvis vs JXL, and younger audience tracks like S Club Junior's "One Step Closer" (as well as The Cure's "Love Cats" for anyone who may claim not to like pop music), no-one will be able resist getting footloose. Those waiting their turn can sing along courtesy of karaoke-style lyrics that appear on the bottom of the screen. Points to note: a dance mat is not strictly necessary (though very much recommended), and you can turn off the background booing during game play via the Options menu. &#151;Mel Pring

                                    <p>If the world was a fair place then the name of SoulCalibur&#151;peculiar spelling mistake and all&#151;would be the most famous in beat-'em-up history. Unfortunately, though, the original arcade game was only converted to the Dreamcast (despite the prequel, Soul Blade, being on the PSone), thus dooming it to relative obscurity.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        SoulCalibur's brilliance is not due to any particularly innovative features&#151;it could legitimately be described as simply Tekken with weapons. It's just that it does everything with more panache and imagination than the rest. Instead of awkward, staccato moves, SoulCaliburoffers gloriously flowing, instinctive combos that often leaves you gasping at your own character's athleticism.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Of course beat-'em-ups aren't known for their innovation and SoulCalibur IIdoesn't really deviate too far from its original premise of 16th century men and women hitting each other with a variety of swords, sticks and other meleé weapons. The whole tactical nature of the battles has been altered, though, to create a deeper game with blocks and counters now far more important and the glorious new animation system able to adapt each move depending on the direction and speed you're moving in.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        One point of true innovation in the original game was its unusually complex and rewarding single-player mode and this has been expanded for the sequel as you compete under a variety of different conditions to earn money and buy new weapons, costumes and extras. &#151;David Jenkins

                                    <p>Even amongst EA's own stable of titles, Burnoutis regarded by many as the best arcade racer of them all and this fourth iteration, subtitled Revenge, looks like being a solid addition to the line. It seems to have wisely realised that the best bit in any of the Burnoutgames is the amount of destruction you can cause as you race and that all that winning a race malarkey is almost a secondary concern.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        A new revenge meter tracks exactly how much damage you cause as you play skittles with traffic and try to cause as big a pile-up as possible&#151;an activity that is encouraged even further in the new Traffic Attack mode. The actual revenge of the title though comes into play when you prang a specific rival one too many times and they start to take a personal interest in seeing your car go up in flames.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Although it doesn't seem as if the graphics have changed all that much since the last game the level design has certainly become more inventive with huge multi-layer track layouts reminiscent of arcade classic Rave Racer&#151;tearing along an overpass to fall vertically down three levels straight onto an opponent's bonnets is pretty special.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Although surviving any of the game's crashes would be impossible in real-life it has become slightly more realistic in other areas with more car deformation than before and real cities, including Detroit, Rome and Tokyo. Whether the appallingly annoying DJ from the last game is still in it though remains to be seen…&#151;Harrison Dent<br />

                                        This preview is based on an incomplete version of the game; features or problems mentioned above may not appear in the finished game.

                                    <p>LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures takes the fun and creative construction of LEGO and combines it with the wits, daring and non-stop action from the original cinematic adventures that enthralled audiences everywhere (Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the original adventures, LEGO Indiana Jones follows Dr. Jones escapades through the jungles of South America to the mountaintops of India. Fans can build, battle and brawl their way through their favorite cinematic moments, from Indy's entanglements with snakes to his dashing boulder run.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Of course, pop culture's most iconic archeologist will whip through all the classic moments with the help of a host of supporting characters including Marion Ravenwood and Short Round. Players can also mix and match the body parts of more than 60 playable characters to create new heroes just as they could in the best-selling LEGO Star Wars games.
