                                        <p>Jack McCoy and Billabong are re-releasing the classics, Bunyip Dreaming, Sons Of Fun, The Green Iguana and Sik Joy in a special edition four pack DVD box set. The old VHS copies must have the tape burnt off them due to excessive play so its time to upgrade those treasured puppies to digitally remastered sweetness. Days and days of flat day viewing featuring all your favourites, Occy, Munga, Luke Egan and the emerging young talents of Donovan, Margo and Shane Dorian. When McCoy was rolling precious film on these boys during the mid nineties, times were different and movie deadlines were dictated by time spent in the pit, not the labour of following phantom Internet swells around the globe. Mate, back then we wouldnt even look at the forecast, Margo recalls. It was all about rocking up to a place for a few weeks and just dealing with whatever we got. Nine times out of ten it just panned out. I mean I was twenty years old, just cruising around, surfing the best waves in Australia. The early McCoy classics didnt mess about when it came to the beats either, rocking the likes of Powder Finger, Celibate Rifles, INXS, Hunters and Collectors, The Cruel Sea, Yothu Yindi, Ed Kuepper and Dig. McCoy has returned to edit room and created a Making Of that takes you behind the scenes of each separate classic. Expect to see candid cuts that never made the original edits and some all time bonus clips on this new special set. Over the last two years on the road showing Blue Horizon and Free As A Dog people were constantly asking me when Bunyip, Iguana, Sons, and Sik Joy were going to make it to DVD, said McCoy. After many years, I finally sat down and watched them again and was pleasantly surprised how entertaining and fun they are today. I think they have really stood the test of time and I decided it was time to get them out on DVD. This will really bring back memories for all the people who have called them Classics for many years.</p>

                                        <p>Spaced is a sitcom like no other. The premise is simple enough: Daisy (Jessica Stevenson) and Tim (Simon Pegg) are out of luck and love, so pretend to be a couple in order to rent a flat together. Downstairs neighbour and eccentric painter Brian suspects someone's fibbing, and almost blows their cover with their lecherous lush of a landlady, Marsha. Fortunately he soon falls for Daisy's health-freak friend Twist, while Daisy herself goes ga-ga for pet dog Colin. Tim remains happily platonic with lifemate Mike; a sweet-at-heart guns 'n' ammo obsessive. The series is chock-full of pop culture references. In fact, each episode is themed after at least one movie, with nods to The Shining and Close Encounters of the Third Kind proving especially hilarious. Hardly five minutes goes by without a Star Wars reference, and every second of screen time from Bill Bailey as owner of the comic shop where Tim works is comedic gold. The look of the series is its other outstanding element, with slam-zooms, dizzying montages, and inspired lighting effects (often paying homage to the Evil Dead movies). It's an affectionate fantasy on the life of the twenty-something that's uncomfortably close to the truth.<br />

                                            On the DVD: The disc also includes trailers, out-takes, deleted scenes with commentary, cast, crew, and character biographies and a full audio commentary by the director and cast. —Paul Tonks</p>

                                        <p>"Jump in we'll take you for a spin/And show you round the Wheelie World" . For pretty much anyone between the ages of 25 and 40, merely the opening line of the theme to this crazed slice of cartoon bedlam will be enough to jog memories and pluck heartstrings. For everyone else, a brief synopsis is probably in order. Well, self-evidently there's Chorlton, the least intimidating dragon in television history, whose unexplained arrival among the Wheelies is a constant source of vexation to Fenella, a spectacularly ineffective witch with a base camp at Spout Hall (yes, it's a big kettle) and a cadre of mushroom-like toadies and "spikers" with whom she consorts to bring havoc to Wheelie World. Oh, and she also has a son, who only ever appears as a vast, disembodied foot.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In short, Chorlton is a crown jewel for all fans of 70s children's TV at its most unapologetically demented. The first series opens with "Happiness is Hatched", wherein, of course, Chorlton arrives fully formed in Wheelie World via an enormous egg. Needless to say, the ever-apoplectic Fenella remains hysterical throughout. —Danny Leigh</p>

                                        <p>The second series of Spaced finds the gang at 23 Meteor Street a little older, but definitely none the wiser. Tim's career is hampered by severe hang-ups over The Phantom Menace. Daisy's career is just plain non-existent. There is still a spark of sexual tension between them, but it's overshadowed by Brian and Twist getting it on. Propelling the seven-episode series arc is the threat of Marsha discovering that none of the relationships are what they seem, Mike's increasing jealousy and a new love interest for Tim. That's the basis for a never-ending stream of in-jokes and references that easily match the quality of the first series. Tim has a Return of the Jedi flashback, then déjà vu in reliving the end of The Empire Strikes Back. There are spoofs of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Robocop, The Sixth Sense and comedy rival The Royle Family. There are guest spots from Bill Bailey, Peter (voice of Darth Maul) Serafinowicz and The League of Gentlemen's Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith. Every episode is packed with highlights, but this series' guaranteed geek pant-wetting moments have to be the mock gun battles, slagging off Babylon 5 and learning that "The second rule of Robot Club is: no smoking." Jessica Stevenson won a British Comedy Award for this year. It deserved a whole lot more.—Paul Tonks<br />

                                            On the DVD: There's a chaotic but highly enthusiastic commentary from the director and cast, including of course Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, who also talk about some deleted scenes and why they were removed. There's an outtakes blooper reel, as well as a selection of raw location footage and a self-explanatory clip, "Daisy Does Elvis". The most useful feature, though, is the subtitle "Homage-o-Meter" facility, which displays all the movie references throughout the series. —Mark Walker</p>

                                        <p>Circlereminds us that, despite his less than successful dalliances with film and TV, Eddie Izzard's reputation rests securely on his genius for stand-up comedy. Circlecomes on the back of an ever-growing global touring schedule, with this particular performance being recorded in New York. Always sensitive to his environment, the comedian throws in several local references to gratify his strongly partisan audience. Much of the delight of an Izzard performance is watching him weave from topic to topic, often painting himself into a corner, and Circleis no exception. A little slow to get started, once he finds his stride this is a veritable masterclass in live comedy, dealing with subjects ranging from the absurd to the everyday. Indeed, Izzard is almost a human equivalent of The Far Sidecartoon series, weaving the worlds of the bizarre and the ordinary together to make fresh points: witness his show-stopping account of the Death Star canteen. This is a must for all fans, equally so for those yet to fall under his spell. —Phil Udell</p>

                                        <p>Despite voluminous protest and nitpicking criticism from loyal fans of the original TV series (1978-80), the 2003 version of Battlestar Galacticaturned out surprisingly well for viewers with a tolerance for change. Originally broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channelin December 2003 and conceived by Star Trek: The Next Generationalumnus Ronald D Moore as the pilot episode for a "reimagined" TV series, this four-hour mini series reprises the basic premise of the original show while giving a major overhaul to several characters and plot elements. Gone are the flowing robes, disco-era hairstyles, and mock-Egyptian fighter helmets, and thankfully there's not a fluffy "Daggit" in sight... at least, not yet. Also missing are the "chrome toaster" Cylons, replaced by new, more formidable varieties of the invading Cylon enemy, including "Number Six" in hot red skirts and ample cleavage, who tricks the human genius Baltar! into a scenario that nearly annihilates the human inhabitants of 12 colonial worlds.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Thus begins the epic battle and eventual retreat of a "ragtag fleet" of humans, searching for the mythical planet Earth under the military command of Adama (Edward James Olmos) and the political leadership of Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), a former secretary of education, 43rd in line of succession and rising to the occasion of her unexpected Presidency. As directed by Michael Rymer (Queen of the Damned), Moore's ambitious teleplay also includes newfangled CGI space battles (featuring "handheld" camera moves and subdued sound effects for "enhanced realism"), a dysfunctional Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) who's provoked into action by the insubordinate Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff), and a father-son reunion steeped in familial tragedy. To fans of the original BGseries, many of these changes are blasphemous, but for the most part they work—including an ominous cliffhanger ending. The remade Galacticais brimming with smart, well-drawn characters ripe with dramati! c potential, and it readily qualifies as serious-minded science fiction, even as it gives BGloyalists ample fuel for lively debate. —Jeff Shannon</p>

                                        <p>No one uses colour like Chinese director Zhang Yimou—movies like Raise the Red Lanternor Hero, though different in tone and subject matter, are drenched in rich, luscious shades of red, blue, yellow, and green. House of Flying Daggersis no exception; if they weren't choreographed with such vigorous imagination, the spectacular action sequences would seem little more than an excuse for vivid hues rippling across the screen. Government officers Leo and Jin (Asian superstars Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro) set out to destroy an underground rebellion called the House of Flying Daggers(named for their weapon of choice, a curved blade that swoops through the air like a boomerang). Their only chance to find the rebels is a blind women named Mei (Ziyi Zhang, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) who has some lethal kung fu moves of her own. In the guise of an aspiring rebel, Jin escorts Mei through gorgeous forests and fields that become bloody battlegrounds as soldiers try to kill them both. While arrows and spears of bamboo fly through the air, Mei, Jin, and Leo turn against each other in surprising ways, driven by passion and honour. Zhang's previous action/art film, Hero, sometimes sacrificed momentum for sheer visual beauty;House of Flying Daggersfinds a more muscular balance of aesthetic splendour and dazzling swordplay. —Bret Fetzer, Amazon.com</p>

                                        <p>In the six-part British "vampire-slaying" mini-series Ultraviolet we discover that UV light is used (both in surgery and via high-tech weaponry) to identify people who have been infected with a disease labelled "Code 5". It's transmitted via a bite to the neck, but at no point in the series is the word "vampire" used. Instead, in the second episode ("In Nomine Patris") the nickname "Leech" is introduced. We learn that it was this disease, these "Leeches", that were responsible for the Fire of London, and that one in 20 people are already infected. In the opening episode, policeman Michael Colefield (Jack Davenport) is recruited into the secretive CIB. He meets its introverted priest-chief Pearse (Philip Quast), the emotionally driven Dr Angela March (Susannah Harker) and the bullish heavyweight Vaughan (Idris Elba). Spinning around Mike's suddenly complicated life are his best friend's jilted fiancée Kirstie (Colette Brown) and old flame Frances (Fiona Dolman). In later hard-hitting episodes we see a 12-year-old boy stab his teacher priest to death ("Mea Culpa") and the capture of a "Leech" ("Persona Non Grata"). This intriguing series ends having tied together most of its threads, but dangles worrying implications at the viewer... not so much to suggest a sequel as to hammer home everything at stake. —Paul Tonks</p>

                                        <p>Hit man Martin Q Blank (John Cusack) is in an awkward situation. Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) why he stood her up on prom night. Grosse Pointe Blankis an amiable black comedy, cowritten by Cusack and directed by Jonathan Demme protégé George Armitage (Miami Blues), has the feel of Demme's Something Wildand Married to the Mob—which is to say its humour is dark and brightly coloured at the same time. Cusack and Driver are utterly charming—as is the leading man's sister, Joan, who plays his secretary. (Cusack received an Oscar nomination for her next role, in In &amp; Out.) Alan Arkin is also very funny as Martin's psychiatrist. —Jim Emerson</p>
