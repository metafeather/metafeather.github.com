## DESIRED ROLE
Liam Clancy, 38, a UK resident.
I have recently returned from 6 months travelling and diving in South and Central America.

After my project, jsHub, was acquired by Causata as their standard data capture and analytics library, I stayed on to modernise their Javascript application production process and to introduce a UI testing infrastructure, as well as to contribute many core features to their flagship application Insight.

Prior to this I had worked with many of the same team at Omniture Test&Target (formerly TouchClarity) where I analysed and restructured the core Javascript framework development process, built a team and helped established the future product integration strategy, including the absorption of Omniture and Offermatica Javascript products and services.

I am interested in innovative and creative projects/products relating to user experience and the creation of extraordinary web applications.

I am seeking a permanent, senior, Web/Software Developer role within a core team in an established startup or new company.

## PROFILE
Since 1993, I have applied Design Management concepts to the Internet and New Media companies in which I am involved. My current passion is with Developer Evangelism and Experience.

I am an Internet and Design professional who excels at problem solving, able to work on my own initiative, and mange a team, with a strong technical background, an excellent ability and interest in learning new skills, and the ability to communicate at all levels.

I am honest, and have a positive and diligent attitude to tasks and prefer to work with progressive and innovative organisations.

I am a natural Team Leader and policy instigator, and seek to automate and improve the administration and production processes of New Media companies and their clients.

For the last 7 years my focus has been to enhance the user experience and interface of Web Applications by use of W3C standard technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS), popular initiatives (WAI, Microformats) and other plugin media (Flash, QuickTime).

For the last 4 years this experience has been applied to enhancing customer facing applications, system administration tools and real-time business reporting.

I am an expert in the effective use of all client-side related technologies, and particularly their integration with server-side based systems (Rails, PHP, XSLT, J2EE, JSP, Servlet, Perl CGI) or use on mobile platforms such as iPhone. These skills have been utilised for the timely deployment of financial and rich-media information and content.

I am also an expert in automating the production and deployment process on UNIX/Linux or Windows platforms in a robust and secure manner (Git, CVS, SVN, Ant, Perl, Bash, SSH/SCP, XML, RSS).

My solutions are visible, standards compliant, robust, degrade gracefully and are backwards/forwards compatible.

In addition, I actively participate in web technology strategy, Information Architecture (IA), the New Media production process, and the enhancement of cross-disciplinary communication.

## KEY ROLES AND ACHIEVEMENTS

> **Causata.com, Founder and Senior Developer**, Jun 2008 – Nov Nov 2012

Funded by Accel, Causata is a multi channel Predictive Analytics solution using Big Data with Machine Learning.

I was a founder of the company with the responisbility of producing a vendor neutral, but professionally designed, opensource web analytics javascript library. This project became jsHub and, after it was reviewed by members of the Google Analytics, Webtrends, Omniture and Coremetrics engineering teams, it was adopted by Causata as a core component of the predictive analytics platform, as it was able to collect and respond to more data in a more efficient manner than other solutions available.

For the jsHub project I also developed advanced processes for the automated testing and deployment of web UI’s and this technology was adopted by the UI development team as their QA platform.

This QA platform directly lead to the improvement of the in-house high performance javascript framework for data visualisations and interaction (Insight), as well as enabling the re-factoring of key, but less performance critical, applications in ExtJS and the ability to recruit more team members and deliver further high-quality UI’s for other areas of their platform (Decisioning, Variable Management).

Causata is currently successfully expanding its client baseand technology across the US competing successfully with Adobe, SAS, IBM and Oracle.

> **Omniture Test&Target (TouchClarity), Senior Web Engineer**, Jan 2006 – Jun 2008

Omniture provide business intelligence solutions for online clients, including fully automated Onsite Behavioural Targeting and reports.

As the Senior Web Engineer I was recruited to professionalise and productise the Javascript framework responsible for all DataCapture and ContentServing on client sites, utilising best practices garnered from my own years of experience and emerging techniques from the newly revitalised online Opensource and front-end engineering communities after the wide-spread adoption of AJAX techniques.

This involved putting in place all processes for the development, testing, QA and deployment of all Javascript resources throughout the company and customisation for its clients, as well as the ongoing training and support at all levels of Javascript based technologies as a whole, including their effective use in traditional Web UI’s, and in other products.

In the month of June 2007 my code was responsible for more than 1 billion safe DataCapture and ContentServing transactions on Bank of America’s homepage.

After our acquisition by Omniture and also during the subsequent merger with Offermatica I was responsible for Javascript, implementation and UI integration strategies.

> **Barclays Business Manager, Internet Manager & Technical Analyst** for Barclays Clearlybusiness, Jan 2004 – Aug 2005

Barclays Clearlybusiness is a financial product development and support channel for Barclays Small Business clients.

As the Technical Analyst my role was to initiate the analysis and re-deployment of their existing 3 tier web platform, deployed with ATG Dynamo (J2EE App Server) and Interwoven TeamSite (CMS), to create innovative and effective revenue streams.

An early project was the design and implementation of the Clearlybusiness Accountants affiliation programme that enhanced the existing penetration of Clearlybusiness’ software with Barclay’s clients.

The last was the implementation of the Red Hat Linux server-side infrastructure for ‘Barclays Business Manager’, a subscription based authentication framework.
This also included the design and development of the end user web administration, configuration and management application and UI, and content deployment administration.

This platform also further developed the affiliate services supplied to members of the Clearlybusiness Accountants programme.

Barclays Business Manger is a successful revenue stream for Barclays bank, and its first with a subscription business model. Further funding for the project has been secured for its expansion into South Africa and other markets.

> **E4.com, Senior Client-Side Web Developer** for &lt;kpe&gt;, August 2000 – September 2001

The E4 web-site was a broadband entertainment portal that supported the launch of Channel4's entertainment channel in 2001.

The E4.com interface required the development of a client-side DHTML API, and integration with server-side JSP and an Interwoven Content Management system to create a desktop-like user interface that provides simultaneous access to broadband categorised content in many media formats (Flash, DHTML, Real, Java Applet).

My role was to develop and implement the unique client-side user interface that allows users to access the content.

This required the development and administration of the server platform and CMS setup with Channel4 editor input, extensive consultation regarding the interface design and the solution of many unique content browser and plug-in media related issues. Bespoke solutions to enable search engine accessibility and advertising server connectivity were also developed.

The DHTML API was adapted from the Open-source project 'DynAPI2', and was built in object oriented JavaScript. My responsibilities included the QA of the API, generation of customisable interface widgets, and functional extensions to add support for Netscape 6's release during the project period. This technique has been more recently utilised by Google with GMail and Google Maps and is now termed AJAX.

Additionally the DHTML API was documented and made available, along with secure server access to 3rd party content creators for use in development of microsites and other content, for which I was the primary co-ordinator.

E4.com was the first site of its kind in Europe. Shortly after launch, the site was reaching 1.3 million U.K. adults between the ages of 16-34 every week, and now having achieved its goals has been wholly incorporated into the main Channel4 web-site.

> **Fotango.com, Senior Client-Side Web Developer** for &lt;kpe&gt;, September 2000 – March 2001

Fotango.com is an online photography site. All activities are managed behind a security system to protect the privacy and copyright of its members.

The Fotango.com site implements a server-side categorisation system built in PHP and Perl CGI which uses an extensive set of modular HTML templates (now Template Toolkit) to provide an engaging and functional interface for the manipulation of the pictures. Some of these functions are enhanced by the use of DHTML.

My role was the complete implementation of the client-side requirements of this project including competition research for the project pitch, IA and user-flow development, design interpretation and code generation of the templates.

Fotango.com became the first European site of its kind and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Canon Europe.

<code>http://www.fotango.com/</code><br>

> **Flutter.com, Senior Client-Side Web Developer** for &lt;kpe&gt;, November 1999 – February 2000

Flutter.com is an online betting exchange which acts as a broker and provides the technology to match bets placed by individuals.

An advanced standalone browser based prototype was constructed for Flutter.com that emulated database interaction via object orientated JavaScript and cookies. This prototype was then used to determine optimal user-flow and data representation, and provided the basis for an external team in San Francisco to build the server-side system in JSP.

My team was solely responsible for the completion of the prototype phase of the project in direct communication with the client, and initial integration with the server-side code.

The Flutter prototype successfully conveyed a complicated concept to the company investors and contributed towards the achievement of additional investment.

Flutter.com was the first person-to-person based betting site of its kind in Europe and is now owned by Betfair.
